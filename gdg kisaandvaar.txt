Problem Statement:
Harvesting the Future: AI Solutions for Smallholder Farmers
Smallholder farmers, who produce a significant portion of the world’s food, often lack access to advanced tools and technologies to optimize their farming practices. This results in lower crop yields, inefficient resource use, and vulnerability to climate change, threatening global food security.

Objective:
Developing AI-based solutions that empower smallholder farmers with real-time insights and recommendations. Solutions should leverage AI for crop monitoring, pest detection, and resource optimization, ensuring scalability and affordability for farmers in developing regions.

• What is a PWA?
– A PWA is essentially a web app enhanced with modern web technologies (like service workers and a web manifest) to work offline, load quickly, and provide a seamless experience.
– It can be “installed” on a device and even work when there is little or no network connectivity.

• Key Frontend Tasks:
– Manifest File (manifest.json):
• Define your app’s name, icons, theme colors, start URL, and display options.
– Service Worker:
• Write a service worker script that caches static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) so the app loads quickly, even offline.
• Implement caching strategies (like cache-first or network-first) for both static and dynamic content.
• Handle fetch events to serve cached resources when offline.
– Offline Fallback UI:
• Design fallback pages or error messages to inform users when they are offline.
– Performance Optimization:
• Optimize code and assets to reduce CPU and battery usage, ensuring smooth offline operation.
– Testing & Debugging:
• Use browser developer tools to simulate offline mode and ensure that caching and service worker behaviors work as intended.

PWA:
• Backend Integration Tasks:
– Offline Synchronization Endpoints:
• Create API endpoints that allow the app to synchronize data (like inventory updates or chat messages) when the connection is restored.
• Ensure the backend supports conflict resolution in case of discrepancies between local and server data.
– Push Notifications:
• Set up backend services to trigger push notifications via the service worker when new content or updates are available.
• Development Phase Considerations:
– Early Planning:
• PWA features must be planned early in the development lifecycle. This ensures that both the caching strategies and offline synchronization mechanisms are integrated from the start.
– Parallel Development:
• While the frontend team focuses on building the manifest, service worker, and offline UI, the backend should simultaneously work on endpoints that support offline data sync.
– Iterative Testing:
• Continuously test the PWA’s offline capabilities during development, ensuring smooth transitions between online and offline states.
